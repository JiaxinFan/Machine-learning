You can use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

In your answer, refer back to the *Adult* data set used in this assignment. **[1 mark]**\n",
